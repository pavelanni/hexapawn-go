== The game

The game description is in this article by Martin Gardner: https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/model-free/1991-gardner-ch8amatchboxgamelearningmachine.pdf

The physical implementation is described at link:https://www.instructables.com/Matchbox-Mini-Chess-Learning-Machine/[Instructables].

=== The rules

From the article linked above:

Hexapawn is played on a 3 x 3 board, with three chess
pawns on each side as shown in Figure 43.
Dimes and pennies can be used instead of actual chess pieces.
Only two types of move are allowed:

* A pawn may advance straight forward one square to an empty square
* A pawn may capture an enemy pawn by moving one square diagonally, left or right,
to a square occupied by the enemy.
The captured piece is removed from the board.
These are the same as pawn moves in chess, except that no double move,
_en passant_ capture or promotion of pawns is permitted.

The game is won in any of three ways:

. By advancing a pawn to the third row.
. By capturing all enemy pieces.
. By achieving a position in which the enemy cannot move.

Players alternate moves, moving one piece at a time.
A draw clearly is impossible, but it is not immediately apparent whether the first or second player has the advantage.
