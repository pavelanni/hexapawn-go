== The game

The game description is in this article by Martin Gardner: https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/model-free/1991-gardner-ch8amatchboxgamelearningmachine.pdf

The physical implementation is described at link:https://www.instructables.com/Matchbox-Mini-Chess-Learning-Machine/[Instructables].

=== The rules

From the article linked above:

Hexapawn is played on a 3 x 3 board, with three chess
pawns on each side as shown in Figure 43.
Dimes and pennies can be used instead of actual chess pieces.
Only two types of move are allowed:

* A pawn may advance straight forward one square to an empty square
* A pawn may capture an enemy pawn by moving one square diagonally, left or right,
to a square occupied by the enemy.
The captured piece is removed from the board.
These are the same as pawn moves in chess, except that no double move,
_en passant_ capture or promotion of pawns is permitted.

The game is won in any of three ways:

. By advancing a pawn to the third row.
. By capturing all enemy pieces.
. By achieving a position in which the enemy cannot move.

Players alternate moves, moving one piece at a time.
A draw clearly is impossible, but it is not immediately apparent whether the first or second player has the advantage.

== Data structures

We need a data structure that defines a board position and a way to describe a move.
We'll have a map where for each board position we'll have a list of possible moves.

A board position is encoded as a string of form: `www...bbb` where `w` and `b` are white and black pawns, and `.` are empty squares.

A move is encoded by an `int` slice of form `{2, 5}` which means that the white pawn in the middle of the bottom row
moves one square up to the middle of the middle row.
In this case we use human-friendly numbering that is starting from 1.

Another way to encode moves is to define the position _after_ the move, assuming that all moves are applied to a certain position.
This one is a bit harder to encode without making mistakes, but it will be easier to use in the program.

Let's see which one is better.
Probably for this 3x3 board it's easier to encode the positions for each move.
If we are going to expand the game to 4x4 or more it will be better to generate moves according to the rules and
generate end positions for each move programmatically.
